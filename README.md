# Izm12

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.7. This is a rework of an older project using Angular 12 and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) version 12.2.8.

## Prerequisites

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run.

#### IMPORTANT!

Run `npm i` before starting! :wink:

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server + json REST API scenario. API data is stored as one json file in the `src/` directory *and is temporary*. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` for webpage and `http://localhost:3000/` for data.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## TODO:
- [x] Implement classic navy/white light theme with switch to standard material dark theme.

- [x] Rework important-view page.

- [ ] Remake First day / Second day info 

- [ ] Implement error handling.
